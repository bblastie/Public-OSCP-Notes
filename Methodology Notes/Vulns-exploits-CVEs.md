# Vulnerabilities vs Exploits vs CVEs
## A quick overview of a few terms:

> A vulnerability is flaw in a system which COULD provide an attacker with a way into the software itself, in a unattended manner.
It is not an open door, but a weak door, which MIGHT allow an attacker a way in.

> A exploit is the way INTO the system. An attacker turns the vulnerability into a method into the system.
An exploit is the tool used to bust down the door - allowing the attacker to walk through the door.

> 0day means the exploit has been known about for less than a day. So the software authors didn't have any notice/chance to create a patch, to protect from the vulnerability.
â€‹Someone has found a way to bust down a door without giving the chance to put up any protections, stopping the attack from happening.

> 1day means the vulnerability is publicly known about, allowing for the software authors to create a patch. However, there isn't yet any public exploit code.
Able to protect a door from being busted down even though there isn't yet a known way to open the door.

> CVE is a standard, for making a list of vulnerabilities, using a certain naming format and terms. It makes it easier to identity and reference vulnerabilities.
Able to identity what the issue is.

>A "feature" is using the software how it was designed in order to perform an action
Such as allowing file uploads on a web site, to share pictures, might also allow for web shells to be uploaded.



Please note:
- Not every vulnerability can be exploited (for various reasons).
- Not every vulnerability has an exploit (for various reasons).
- Not every vulnerability or exploit is "public" (Sometimes are kept "private" so they are not shared with anyone or required to be purchased. Sometimes these vulnerabilities are not even publicly known about!)
- Not every vulnerability has a CVE (for various reasons).
- There are other naming conventions than CVEs to identity issues (such as Microsoft's Bulletins).
- There might be multiple exploits for the same vulnerability (e.g. re-written in different coding languages).
- One exploit might use/target multiple vulnerabilities.
- Exploits may get updated over time (just like any other software)!
- Exploits may affect a range of software versions (depends on the vulnerability, which depends on the code used in the software in the first place).
- It's possible to chain vulnerabilities to create a exploit (Allowing to access/reach places in code which normally wouldn't be accessible).
- Some "Denial of Service (DoS)" exploits are the beginning of creating a PoC exploit. Not every DoS exploit can be converted (goes back to not every vulnerability can be exploited).
- A "Proof of Concept (PoC)" exploit is to demonstrate the vulnerability is exploitable. Depending on the state of the PoC, it may require work in order to reach desired goal (E.g. it displays a pop up alert, rather than executing commands on the target). These are not always stable.
- A weaponized exploit, means the payload will work for everyone/anyone every time, out of the box without any configuration needed. These are stable.
