# Public-OSCP-Notes

This is my attempt to share my methodology that I use for OSCP studying with people I encounter. One of the most fun parts of doing OSCP has been meeting people also working on this goal and sharing information. 

In this repo you will find my note templates, resources I have gathered, and a few scripts. I plan to continuously update this as my Offensive Security adventure unfolds.
